        <h2><u>Interest<hr></u></h2>
        <blockqoute><p>
            In terms of interest during the pademic days, I said that I have passion playing computer games.<sup>[1]</sup> so I like to watch tournaments games so i learned and saw the possible <b>moves and strategies</b> that I can <b>apply to enhance my own computer games skills.</b><sup>[2]</sup> this moment i interest collecting some <b>toy figure</b> that give me happy to i see it.<sup>[3]</sup> about <b>toy figures</b> i have <b>25 toy figures</b> i think our house is like a <b>toy museum.</b><sup>[4]</sup> During the pandemic I liked <b>live streaming</b> on fb and it was one of my favorite things because I like computers games, so my brother recommended it to <b>start live streaming.</b><sup>[5]</sup> I really like going through and watching influencers these days, but I'm debating it because after watching them, I found that practically all of them have <b>apparel lines.</b><sup>[6]</sup> I am greatly inspired by their <b>ingenuity and talent</b> in design.<sup>[7]</sup> Observing their artwork <b>inspires me to try my hand at designing clothes.</b><sup>[8]</sup> Thus, it's a great approach to develop as an artist.<sup>[9]</sup> Last but not least, the reason I went into the <b>IT industry</b> was my desire to learn how to program and my desire to build websites that would assist students, faculty, and other users. After receiving my BSIT, from the University of the Philippines in Manila, I hope to work as a <b>web developer or designer.</b><sup>[10]</sup><br><br><br>
